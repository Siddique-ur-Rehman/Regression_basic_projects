# Student Performance Prediction

This project predicts how well a student will perform based on factors like their study hours, past scores, and extracurriculars.

## Overview

We use a **multiple linear regression** model to predict a student's "Performance Index." This model was trained on data from 10,000 students and its accuracy was checked using mean squared error and the R-squared score.

### Model Performance

*   **Mean Squared Error:** 4.01
*   **R-squared Score:** 0.988

## Files

*   `Student_Performance.csv`: The data used to train and test our model.
*   `Student_Performance_Prediction.ipynb`: The Python code for preparing the data, training the model, and checking how well it works.
*   `requirements.txt`: A list of the Python libraries you'll need to run the code.

## How to Use

1.  **Get the code:** You can either clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file.
2.  **Install what's needed:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and type: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  **Run the code:** Open and run the `Student_Performance_Prediction.ipynb` notebook in a program like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
