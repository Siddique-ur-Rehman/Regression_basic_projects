## 🚀 Projects

Here are the projects included in this collection. Click on any project title to navigate to its dedicated folder, which contains the code, dataset, and a detailed breakdown.

### 1. [Simple Linear Regression: Salary Prediction](Simple_Linear_Regression/)

*   **🎯 Goal:** To predict an employee's salary based on their years of experience.
*   **📖 Overview:** This project serves as a great introduction to the fundamentals of machine learning. It uses a simple linear regression model to find the relationship between two variables and create a predictive tool.
*   **📊 Dataset:** `Salary_dataset.csv`
*   **🏆 Performance:** The model achieved a high **R-squared value of 0.94**, indicating a strong and reliable fit.

### 2. [Multiple Linear Regression: Student Performance Prediction](Multiple_Linear_Regression/)

*   **🎯 Goal:** To predict a student's academic performance based on multiple lifestyle and study factors.
*   **📖 Overview:** This project demonstrates the power of multiple linear regression. We predict a student's "Performance Index" using factors like study hours, past scores, and extracurricular activities.
*   **📊 Dataset:** `Student_Performance.csv`
*   **🏆 Performance:** The model shows excellent accuracy with an **R-squared score of 0.988** and a very low **Mean Squared Error of 4.01**.
