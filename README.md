## ðŸš€ Featured Projects

Below is a summary of the analytical projects available in this repository. Each project is self-contained within its respective directory, which includes the source code, dataset, and in-depth documentation.

### 1. [Simple Linear Regression: Salary Forecasting](Simple_Linear_Regression/)

*   **Objective:** To forecast an employee's salary as a function of their years of professional experience.
*   **Synopsis:** This project establishes a foundational understanding of machine learning by implementing a simple linear regression model. It effectively models the linear relationship between two continuous variables to create a reliable predictive instrument.
*   **Dataset:** `Salary_dataset.csv`
*   **Model Efficacy:** The model demonstrates a high degree of correlation, with an **R-squared value of 0.94**, signifying that 94% of the variance in salary is explained by the years of experience.

### 2. [Multiple Linear Regression: Academic Performance Analysis](Multiple_Linear_Regression/)

*   **Objective:** To analyze and predict a student's academic performance index based on a range of lifestyle and academic factors.
*   **Synopsis:** This analysis employs a multiple linear regression model to quantify the impact of several independent variablesâ€”including study duration, prior examination scores, and extracurricular involvementâ€”on a student's academic success.
*   **Dataset:** `Student_Performance.csv`
*   **Model Efficacy:** The model exhibits exceptional predictive accuracy, validated by an **R-squared score of 0.988** and a minimal **Mean Squared Error of 4.01**.
